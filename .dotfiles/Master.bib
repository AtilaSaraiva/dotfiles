  abstract      = {Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have led to many state-of-the-art results spanning through various fields. However, a clear and profound theoretical understanding of the forward pass, the core algorithm of CNN, is still lacking. In parallel, within the wide field of sparse approximation, Convolutional Sparse Coding (CSC) has gained increasing attention in recent years. A theoretical study of this model was recently conducted, establishing it as a reliable and stable alternative to the commonly practiced patch-based processing. Herein, we propose a novel multi-layer model, ML-CSC, in which signals are assumed to emerge from a cascade of CSC layers. This is shown to be tightly connected to CNN, so much so that the forward pass of the CNN is in fact the thresholding pursuit serving the ML-CSC model. This connection brings a fresh view to CNN, as we are able to attribute to this architecture theoretical claims such as uniqueness of the representations throughout the network, and their stable estimation, all guaranteed under simple local sparsity conditions. Lastly, identifying the weaknesses in the above pursuit scheme, we propose an alternative to the forward pass, which is connected to deconvolutional, recurrent and residual networks, and has better theoretical guarantees.},

  abstract = {Migration deconvolution is an image domain approach to least-squares migration, which is considered the state-of-the-art algorithm for obtaining seismic reflectivity models of the earth from seismic acquisition results. Seismic imaging is an active research field with the development over the last few years of several techniques that have mitigated imaging issues. Ongoing research aims to improve image resolution and thus provide a more reliable seismic amplitude for the interpreter. Migration deconvolution can be framed as an inverse problem in the image domain to mitigate image resolution problems and reduce migration artifacts. This paper presents a migration deconvolution method via deep learning based on the Hessian filter least-squares migration (HF-LSM) algorithm. The idea is to use deep learning techniques to model the inverse operator instead of directly estimating the inverse Hessian matrix. A data set is generated from a given velocity model by applying Born modeling to the migrated image, followed by application of the reverse time migration algorithm. The resultant data set is then used to train several neural network models. The networks learn the blurring operator that describes the image degradation due to the effects of acquisition geometry. Three different network topologies were developed to handle this problem: a simple fully convolutional neural network, a U-Net and a generative adversarial network. Our results show that the proposed approach provides images of higher resolution and superior quality than the traditional HF-LSM workflow.},

In fact, these networks can approximate functions that are not differentiable in the classical sense, but possess only a generalized derivative, as is the case for certain piecewise differentiable functions. The conditions imposed on the hidden layer activation function are relatively mild; the conditions imposed on the domain of the function to be approximated have practical implications. Our approximation results provide a previously missing theoretical justification for the use of multilayer feedforward networks in applications requiring simultaneous approximation of a function and its derivatives.},

  abstract  = {Summary Reverse-time de-migration (RTDM) is formulated as the ad-joint operator of reverse-time migration (RTM). In acoustic medium, RTM provides a good approximation to the inverse of RTDM, and can be used to iteratively invert for the reflectivity image in least-squares RTM (LSRTM). In viscoelastic medium, however, the adjoint of the RTDM operator is far from its inverse because of amplitude attenuation during both forward and backward wave propagation. As a result, LSRTM in attenuating medium may suffer from a slow convergence rate due to the ill-conditioned wave-equation Hessian. To improve the convergence rate, we propose preconditioning LSRTM by replacing the original RTM operator with a better approximate inverse to the RTDM operator, namely the Q-compensated RTM (Q-RTM). Since the inverted matrix is numerically non-Hermitian, we use the Generalized Minimum Residual (GMRES) method instead of the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method as the iterative method. Numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed Q-LSRTM approach converges significantly faster than LSRTM, and is capable of producing high-quality attenuation-compensated images within the first few iterations.},
